# Social & Sharing Behavior Research

## Research Question

**Why do people share learning content? What makes them stop scrolling?**

This research investigates sharing psychology, viral etymology content patterns, competitive sharing strategies, and share card design to inform The Journey's sharing experience.

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing viral etymology content, education app sharing strategies, sharing psychology research, and share card design patterns, we've identified key principles for making The Journey's content maximally shareable.

### Key Findings

1. **Etymology is natural social currency** — Sharing word origins signals curiosity and culture without feeling pretentious, because everyone uses words
2. **The surprise gap drives virality** — The bigger the gap between "word I use every day" and "origin I never imagined," the more viral the content
3. **Identity signaling trumps information sharing** — People share to look smart and cultured, not primarily to educate others
4. **84% of sharing is "dark social"** — Most shares happen via DMs and messaging apps, not public posts
5. **Share cards must make the *sharer* look good** — The card is about the user's identity, not the app's brand
6. **Subtle branding beats aggressive CTAs** — Wordle had zero branding yet drove massive organic growth through intrigue
7. **One fact, one card, one moment** — Bundling dilutes the sharing impulse; atomic content units win

### Strategic Recommendations for The Journey

| Priority | Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Poster share card** (already built) | Museum-quality artifact that signals sophistication |
| 2 | **"Hook" share card** | One surprising fact per card — optimized for social currency |
| 3 | **WhatsApp/DM optimization** | Dark social dominates; cards must work in messaging previews |
| 4 | **Seasonal "Year in Etymology"** | Spotify Wrapped-style event creates urgency and FOMO |
| 5 | **Subtle branding only** | Small logo, no CTA — let intrigue drive downloads |

## Part 1: What Makes Etymology Content Go Viral

### Platform-Specific Patterns

#### Twitter/X
- **Dominant format:** Single-tweet with surprising reveal — "The word 'salary' comes from the Latin 'salarium,' which was..."
- **Top accounts:** @HaggardHawks (obscure word definitions), @Etymonline (scholarly origins), various "did you know" accounts
- **What works:** One-punch delivery, image cards with word + origin get more retweets than plain text
- **Framing:** "Look at this cool thing" outperforms "I just learned" by 2-3x for retweets

#### Instagram
- **Dominant format:** Carousel posts (Slide 1: word in large type, Slides 2-5: origin story, Final slide: share prompt)
- **Reels:** Talking head explains a word origin in 30-60 seconds with text overlays
- **Critical factor:** Clean typography and consistent visual branding differentiate accounts that grow

#### TikTok
- **Dominant format:** "Hook and reveal" spoken video — "You use this word every day and you have NO idea where it comes from"
- **Also works:** Green screen format with definition behind creator, duet/stitch correcting someone else's claim
- **EduTok** is a major content category — short educational content thrives on the platform

#### Reddit r/etymology
- **Highest engagement:** "Connection" posts revealing two seemingly unrelated words share a root (e.g., "glamour" and "grammar")
- **Also high:** Everyday words with shocking origins ("nice" originally meant "foolish/stupid," "mortgage" means "death pledge")
- **Question format** gets 2-5x more comments than declarative "TIL" posts
- **Underperforms:** Technical linguistic analysis without a hook, image-only posts without discussion

### The Anatomy of Viral Etymology Content

**What makes it spread:**

1. **The surprise gap is everything** — The word must be familiar; the origin must be unexpected
2. **One word, one origin, one post** — Each word origin is an atomic unit; bundling dilutes sharing impulse
3. **Lead with the familiar word** — "You say 'deadline' every day — it originally meant a line around a prison" outperforms starting with the obscure origin
4. **Visual format matters more than depth** — A well-designed card with 20 words outperforms a 500-word blog post
5. **Connect to identity, not just knowledge** — The best content makes the consumer feel like a more interesting person

### "I Learned This" vs. "Look at This Cool Thing"

| Platform | Better Frame | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Twitter/X | "Look at this cool thing" | Retweet culture rewards curation and authority |
| Instagram | Hybrid | Carousel allows personal hook + polished delivery |
| TikTok | "I learned this" | Authenticity drives the algorithm |
| Reddit | "I learned this" / Question | Community-oriented; invites participation |

**The hybrid that outperforms both:** "I can't believe I never knew this — [cool thing]." Signals personal discovery (relatable) while presenting information as remarkable (shareable).

## Part 2: How Education Apps Drive Sharing

### Competitive Analysis

#### Duolingo: The Streak as Marketing
- **Trigger:** Streak milestones (7, 30, 100, 365 days), leaderboard promotions, course completions
- **Artifact:** Branded card with Duo owl, streak count, fire emoji — immediately recognizable
- **Genius:** The streak is simultaneously a retention mechanic, sharing trigger, and social proof artifact
- **Identity signal:** "I am disciplined and cultured"
- **Social graph:** Friend quests, competitive leagues, notifications about friend activity

#### Brilliant.org: Content as Sharing Artifact
- **Trigger:** Interesting puzzles and problems, not personal milestones
- **Artifact:** The puzzle itself — "Can you solve this?" style problems
- **Key difference:** Appeals to intellectual curiosity, not social comparison
- **The shared content is intrinsically interesting** even without personal achievement attached

#### Headspace / Calm: Gentle Sharing
- **Trigger:** Meditation streaks, minutes meditated, session recommendations
- **Artifact:** Calming, on-brand milestone cards with soft colors and clean typography
- **The paradox:** Meditation is inherently private; aggressive social features feel wrong
- **Solution:** Optional, gentle sharing + content sharing (share a great sleep story)
- **Calm's celebrity content** (Matthew McConaughey sleep stories) created natural shareability

#### MasterClass: Celebrity as Social Currency
- **Trigger:** Gift-giving (entire marketing engine), "I'm taking a class from [Celebrity]" signal
- **Artifact:** The brand itself — saying "I have MasterClass" is the status signal
- **Strategy:** Gift model turns every subscriber into an acquisition channel
- **Almost no in-app social features** — relies on external social signaling

#### Wordle: The Emergent Viral Phenomenon
- **Trigger:** Completing the daily puzzle (universal daily cadence)
- **Artifact:** The colored emoji grid — spoiler-free, platform-agnostic plain text
- **Why it went viral:**
  - Spoiler-free by design (shows path without revealing answer)
  - Universal daily cadence (shared cultural moment)
  - Scarcity (one puzzle per day)
  - Copy-paste native format (works in any app, no image needed)
  - Compact and visual (catches attention without feeling like spam)
  - Zero branding, zero CTA — yet drove massive organic growth
- **Key lesson:** Intrigue and recognition drive more installs than CTAs

#### Notion / Readwise: Artifact as Marketing
- **Notion:** Templates are the viral artifact — users create systems and share them, creating an economy that markets Notion for free
- **Readwise:** Beautiful quote cards from book highlights — the "information DJ" effect
- **Key insight:** The output of using the tool IS the marketing material

### The Spectrum of Social Integration

| Level | App | Approach |
|-------|-----|----------|
| Heavy | Duolingo | Leaderboards, friend lists, competitive leagues |
| Moderate | Notion, Readwise | Functional sharing (collaboration, content) |
| Light | Headspace, Calm | Gentle prompts, milestone cards, no competition |
| Minimal | MasterClass | Brand/celebrity as external social currency |
| Emergent | Wordle | No built-in social; sharing emerged organically |

**The Journey aligns with:** Light to Emergent — museum-quality brand doesn't suit gamified competition, but the content is inherently shareable.

## Part 3: Sharing Psychology

### Berger's STEPPS Framework Applied to Etymology

Jonah Berger's research (*Contagious: Why Things Catch On*) identifies six drivers of sharing:

| STEPPS Principle | Etymology Score | Why |
|------------------|----------------|-----|
| **Social Currency** | Very High | Knowing word origins signals education and curiosity without being pretentious |
| **Triggers** | High | Every time someone encounters a word in daily life, it can trigger recall |
| **Emotion** | Very High | "I never knew that!" triggers awe — the strongest predictor of sharing |
| **Public** | Needs Design | Requires a visual artifact (share card) to leave a public trace |
| **Practical Value** | Moderate | Gives conversational ammunition; "useful at a party" factor |
| **Stories** | Very High | Word origins are inherently micro-stories with characters, settings, transformations |

### Identity Signaling

Research from the NYT Customer Insight Group (2011) on 2,500 heavy sharers found five motivations:
1. Bring valuable content to others (49%)
2. **Define ourselves to others** (68% said sharing gives recipients a better sense of who they are)
3. Grow and nourish relationships (78%)
4. Self-fulfillment (69%)
5. Support causes/brands they care about

Etymology sharing is primarily driven by motivations 1 and 2 — being generous (giving knowledge) while performing identity (showing you're curious and cultured).

**The sweet spot:** Etymology signals intelligence/culture without being pretentious, because word origins are inherently democratic — everyone uses words. This makes it safer social currency than many intellectual topics.

### The Gift Economy of Knowledge

When someone shares an etymology card:
- They give a "gift" of knowledge that costs nothing but signals generosity and expertise
- The recipient receives both the knowledge and the social attention of being "thought of"
- Forwarding to a specific person ("You'd love this — it's about the word X") is especially powerful
- Private sharing (DM/WhatsApp) maps most closely to gift-giving

**Design implication:** Share cards should feel "giftable" — polished enough to feel like giving something of value.

### Three Share Personas

| Persona | Channel | Motivation | Design Need |
|---------|---------|------------|-------------|
| **The Curator** | Public (Instagram, Twitter) | Identity performance, social currency | Visually beautiful cards |
| **The Gift-Giver** | Private (WhatsApp, DM) | Relationship maintenance, generosity | Cards that work in messaging previews |
| **The Collector** | Saves, doesn't share | Personal reference, completionism | Enough information density to be worth saving |

## Part 4: Dark Social — The Hidden Majority

### The Scale

"Dark social" — sharing through private channels (DMs, email, WhatsApp) — accounts for the vast majority of sharing activity:
- 84% of outbound sharing from publisher sites is via dark social (RadiumOne, 2016)
- 65-80% of all sharing activity happens in private channels (GetSocial analysis)
- Education and knowledge content has some of the highest dark social ratios

### Why Dark Social Dominates for Etymology

1. **Lower social risk** — Private sharing has lower identity stakes than public posting
2. **Targeted relevance** — People share with specific individuals they think will appreciate it
3. **Conversation starter** — Private sharing opens a dialogue; public sharing is a broadcast
4. **No performance anxiety** — People worried about seeming pretentious can share privately

### Design Implications

- Copy-link and native share must be frictionless (one tap)
- Share cards must render well in WhatsApp/iMessage link previews
- The card IS the content in dark social — many recipients never click through
- Don't rely solely on analytics — most sharing will be invisible to tracking
- WhatsApp-optimized sharing may matter more than Instagram-optimized for this content type

---

## Part 5: Share Card Design Principles

### Information Density

**The Sweet Spot: 25-40 words**

Working memory holds ~4 chunks of information. Share cards get 1.7-3 seconds of attention in a social feed. The optimal structure:

1. **Hook** (1-3 words): The word itself, visually prominent
2. **Reveal** (1 sentence, ~8-15 words): The surprising origin or connection
3. **Anchor** (optional, 1 short phrase): Context that makes it memorable

**The Cocktail Party Test:** The card should contain exactly enough information that someone could retell it at a cocktail party in one breath.

### Dimensions by Platform

| Use Case | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Instagram/TikTok Story | 1080 x 1920 | 9:16 |
| Instagram Feed Post | 1080 x 1080 | 1:1 |
| Instagram Feed (portrait) | 1080 x 1350 | 4:5 |
| Twitter/X in-feed image | 1200 x 675 | 16:9 |
| OG / Link preview (WhatsApp, iMessage) | 1200 x 630 | 1.91:1 |

**Primary format:** 1080x1920 (9:16) — Instagram Stories and TikTok are the dominant share destinations.

### Design Principles from Spotify Wrapped, Strava, and Wordle

1. **User identity first, app brand second** — The card makes the user look good, not the app
2. **One hero element per card** — One big stat, one striking visual, one idea. Never cram
3. **Design for the destination** — 9:16 for Stories, 1200x630 for link previews
4. **Bold visual identity** — Distinctive colors and typography recognizable at a glance in a feed
5. **Data as narrative** — Turn numbers into stories with context and comparisons
6. **Minimal friction** — One tap to export, pre-formatted for target platform
7. **Subtle branding, no CTA** — Small logo, app name. Never make it feel like an ad
8. **Start with static, layer in animation** — Static is universal; animation is a premium differentiator
9. **Scarcity creates events** — Annual reviews outperform always-available features
10. **Make it beautiful enough to elevate someone's feed** — If the user would be proud to have it in their Stories, they will share it

### Text-to-Visual Ratio

- **The 60/40 rule:** ~60% visual/graphic elements, ~40% text content
- **Maximum 3 text elements** on a share card: headline stat, supporting context, and branding
- **Hierarchy:** One element should be 3-4x larger than others

### Branding Strategy

- Logo present but not dominant — corner placement, 5-8% of card area
- Use brand colors/typography as the primary brand signal, not the logo
- Distinctive visual style is more recognizable than a logo at story size
- **The Wordle principle:** Zero branding drove massive growth through intrigue — let the content speak

## Part 6: Recommendations for The Journey

### Existing Assets

The Journey already has:
- **Poster share card** (implemented) — museum-quality visual artifact
- **SHARE_CARD_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md** — detailed spec for Path, Moment, and Sound card types
- **Night Sky theme** always used for share cards (brand consistency)

### Recommended Enhancements

#### 1. "Hook" Share Card (New — High Priority)

A lightweight card optimized for social currency and dark social:

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Hero** | The word in large Cormorant Garamond |
| **Reveal** | The hook line (e.g., "Arabic coffee houses to your morning cup") |
| **Anchor** | Origin language + century (e.g., "Arabic, 15th century") |
| **Branding** | Small "The Journey" wordmark, bottom corner |

**Why:** The poster card is beautiful but complex. The hook card is atomic — one surprising fact, optimized for the "I can't believe I never knew this" share impulse.

**Format:** 1080x1920 primary (Stories), 1200x630 secondary (OG/link preview)

#### 2. OG Image System (High Priority)

Dynamic Open Graph images for each word page so that link sharing works automatically:

```
https://etymology.life/words/coffee → generates OG image with:
- Word: "Coffee"
- Hook: "From Arabic qahwa to your morning cup"
- Visual: Journey's night sky aesthetic
```

**Why:** 84% of sharing is dark social (copy-paste links). Without good OG images, link shares look generic.

#### 3. WhatsApp/iMessage Optimization

- Ensure OG images render correctly in all messaging apps
- Keep critical content in center 80% of OG image (different apps crop differently)
- The card must be self-contained — many recipients never click through

#### 4. "Year in Etymology" Event (Medium Priority — Future)

Inspired by Spotify Wrapped:
- Annual event: "Your 2026 in Etymology"
- Cards: Words explored, total journey distance, favorite origin language, exploration patterns
- Scarcity: Available for a limited window, creating FOMO
- Personal data + cultural content (like Wrapped)

**Why:** Scarcity + personalization + identity signaling = the most shareable format known.

#### 5. Sharing Triggers (Integrate into Word Pages)

Instead of a generic "share" button, trigger sharing at moments of peak emotion:
- After the hook reveal: "Share this origin"
- After completing a word's journey: "Share your journey"
- On the "relatives" section: "Share the connection"

**Why:** The sharing impulse is strongest at the moment of surprise/awe, not at a generic button.

### What NOT to Build

Based on this research:
- **No leaderboards or competitive features** — doesn't match the museum-quality brand
- **No aggressive share prompts** — gentle and optional, like Headspace
- **No "share to unlock" mechanics** — cheapens the experience
- **No user accounts required to share** — remove all friction

## Part 7: Open Questions for Future Research

1. **What percentage of shares go to dark social vs. public?**
   - Instrument sharing to track channel distribution

2. **Which words get shared most?**
   - Track share events per word to identify patterns

3. **Do hook cards or poster cards get more shares?**
   - A/B test card types on the share flow

4. **What's the conversion rate from share card view to app visit?**
   - Requires OG images with tracking parameters

5. **Should we create platform-specific card variants?**
   - Different formats for Instagram Stories vs. WhatsApp vs. Twitter

6. **Does a "share" prompt at the hook moment increase sharing?**
   - Test contextual vs. persistent share button placement
