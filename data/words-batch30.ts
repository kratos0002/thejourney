      "Incognito is Italian for 'unknown,' from Latin incognitus (in- 'not' + cognitus 'known'). The word entered English in the 1640s specifically for the practice of royalty and nobility traveling under assumed names to avoid the elaborate protocols their real identities required.",
      "The practice was genuinely useful. When a king traveled officially, every city had to provide ceremonial reception, lodging, entertainment, and security—an enormous expense and logistical burden. By traveling 'incognito,' a royal could move freely, observe honestly, and avoid the suffocating performance of sovereignty.",
      "Peter the Great of Russia famously traveled incognito through Western Europe in 1697-1698, working as a shipyard laborer in Amsterdam to learn shipbuilding techniques. His 'disguise' was transparent—he was 6'8\" and traveled with a large entourage—but the fiction of incognito allowed everyone to pretend the Tsar wasn't there.",
      "Today, incognito means any form of concealed identity—traveling incognito, incognito mode in a web browser. The browser version is particularly ironic: 'incognito mode' doesn't actually make you unknown to websites, your ISP, or your employer. It's as transparent a disguise as Peter the Great's."

It's not about being actually unknown—it's about establishing a social contract of non-recognition. The disguise works because everyone agrees to play along."

      "Latin adopted maeander from Greek, and the word entered English in the 1570s. It meant 'to wind' or 'to turn,' specifically of rivers and paths. The extension to human behavior—meandering through a conversation, meandering through life—came later, carrying a mild judgment: to meander is to lack direction.",
      "Today, the Maiandros is called the Büyük Menderes river. The Turkish name preserves the Greek through centuries of linguistic transformation. The river still winds through its valley in exactly the way that made it famous 2,500 years ago. Geography is more permanent than language."
