      "The Arabic word gharbala (غربل) means 'to sift,' 'to sort,' or 'to separate'—specifically, to sift spices, removing impurities from the valuable commodity. When Arab spice traders sold their goods to Italian merchants, the process of sorting and grading became known as garbellare in Italian.",
      "English borrowed the word as garble in the 1400s, initially keeping the Arabic meaning: to garble spices was to sort them, to separate the good from the bad, to purify. A garbler was an official inspector who sorted and graded spices at port. The word meant clarity, not confusion.",
      "The meaning reversed completely over the next two centuries. Because garbling involved selecting some parts and discarding others, it came to suggest incomplete or distorted transmission. If you garbled a message, you'd selected parts and lost others—the result was confused, not clarified. By the 1600s, garble meant the opposite of its original meaning.",
      "Today, garble means exclusively to distort or confuse—garbled speech, a garbled message, garbled instructions. The careful Arab spice-sifter who gave the word its start would be bewildered. His precise, clarifying work now names the very confusion he was trying to eliminate."

If you do it to language, you get confusion. The same action produces opposite results depending on the material."

      "Dulcimer combines elements from Latin dulce ('sweet') and Greek melos ('song' or 'melody'). The compound likely passed through Old French doulcemer before entering English. The instrument—a set of strings stretched across a trapezoidal box, struck with small hammers—produces a bright, ringing tone that apparently struck medieval ears as exceptionally sweet.",
      "The dulcimer family has roots in Persia, where the santur (a hammered dulcimer) has been played for over a thousand years. The instrument traveled westward along trade routes, acquiring different names and forms: santir in Arabic, Hackbrett in German, cimbalom in Hungarian. Each culture reshaped both the instrument and its name.",
      "The English dulcimer appeared in writing by the late 1400s, and the instrument became popular in British folk music. When British settlers carried it to Appalachia, the dulcimer evolved into a distinctive American form—the Appalachian or mountain dulcimer, a simpler, fretted instrument played on the lap rather than struck with hammers.",
      "The dulcimer holds a unique position in English poetry. Coleridge's 'Kubla Khan' famously features 'a damsel with a dulcimer'—an image that connects the instrument to visions of paradise. The word's own meaning—sweet song—made it irresistible to poets long before anyone analyzed its etymology."
