The Persian word is the original.",

The Romans planted pistachio trees across their Mediterranean territories, and the nut became a luxury food associated with wealth and sophistication. The Emperor Vitellius reportedly served pistachios at lavish banquets.",
      "Italian inherited pistacchio from Latin and made the pistachio a cornerstone of Sicilian cuisine—pistachio gelato, pistachio pesto, pistachio mortadella. The town of Bronte on the slopes of Mount Etna became famous for producing the world's finest pistachios, earning the nut the nickname 'green gold.'",
      "English borrowed pistachio from Italian in the 1590s. The nut remained a Mediterranean luxury until the 20th century, when California's Central Valley began commercial pistachio farming in the 1970s. Today, the United States is the world's largest pistachio producer after Iran—the nut returning, in a sense, toward the sun it came from."
