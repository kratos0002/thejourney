  story: [
    "Arabic began as the tongue of nomadic Bedouin tribes in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula. Its earliest written traces appear in 1st-century inscriptions in Nabataean script. But everything changed in 610 CE when, according to Islamic tradition, the Quran was revealed to Muhammad in Arabic — elevating it from a regional language to a sacred one. The Arabic word for 'reading' or 'recitation' — qirāʾa — became the very name of the scripture: al-Qurʾān.",
    "Within a century of Muhammad's death, Arab armies had conquered territories stretching from Spain to Central Asia. Arabic became the language of administration, scholarship, and faith across this vast empire. During the Islamic Golden Age (8th–14th centuries), Arabic was the world's foremost language of science. Scholars in Baghdad, Córdoba, and Cairo translated Greek philosophy, Indian mathematics, and Persian astronomy into Arabic — then advanced every field far beyond what they had inherited.",
    "This is how Arabic words flooded into European languages. When medieval European scholars translated Arabic scientific works into Latin, they brought the Arabic vocabulary with them. Algebra (al-jabr), algorithm (al-Khwārizmī), alchemy (al-kīmiyāʾ), almanac (al-manākh), zenith (al-samt), nadir (naẓīr), cipher (ṣifr) — the language of mathematics, chemistry, and astronomy in English is substantially Arabic.",
    "Today Arabic is spoken natively across 26 countries and serves as the liturgical language of 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide. Its dialects range from Moroccan Darija to Gulf Arabic to Egyptian — different enough that speakers sometimes struggle to understand each other, yet united by Modern Standard Arabic in media, education, and formal speech. Arabic's cursive script, flowing right to left, remains one of the world's great calligraphic traditions.",
