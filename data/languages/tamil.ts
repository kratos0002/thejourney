  story: [
    "Tamil belongs to the Dravidian language family — a group of languages entirely unrelated to the Indo-European family that includes Sanskrit, Persian, and English. While Aryan languages spread across northern India, Dravidian languages held firm in the south. Tamil, with written records stretching back to at least the 3rd century BCE, has one of the longest continuous literary traditions of any living language on Earth.",
    "The Sangam literature (300 BCE – 300 CE) is Tamil's crowning achievement — thousands of poems about love, war, and nature composed by poets at literary academies (sangams) in the ancient city of Madurai. These poems are remarkable for their secular sophistication, psychological depth, and vivid descriptions of landscape and emotion. They rival anything produced in the ancient world and predated Dante by a thousand years.",
    "Tamil's relationship with Sanskrit is complex and fascinating. As a Dravidian language, Tamil's grammar, core vocabulary, and sound system are fundamentally different from Sanskrit. But centuries of coexistence led to deep mutual influence. Sanskrit borrowed Dravidian words (including possibly 'orange,' originally from Tamil 'nāram'). Tamil absorbed Sanskrit vocabulary for religion and philosophy. The South Asian Sprachbund — a zone of convergent features across unrelated language families — is one of linguistics' most studied phenomena.",
    "Today, Tamil is spoken by 78 million people across Tamil Nadu (India), northern Sri Lanka, Singapore (where it is an official language), and a vast global diaspora. Tamil's influence on English comes through maritime trade: catamaran (kaṭṭumaram, 'tied wood'), curry (kaṟi), pariah (paṟaiyar), and possibly mango and ginger. The Tamil Nadu government has declared Tamil a 'classical language' — and at over 2,000 years of continuous literary tradition, the claim is hard to dispute.",
