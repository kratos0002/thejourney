    meaningNow: "'Thug' has become one of the most contested words in contemporary English. Its use sometimes carries racial coding, and 'thug life' has been reclaimed and repurposed.\n\nThe original Thuggee cult is largely forgotten outside historical circles. The word now carries meanings its Marathi speakers never imagined — and debates they couldn't have predicted."

    story: [
      "In Hindi, lūṭ (लूट) means 'plunder, robbery, spoils.' The word comes from Sanskrit loptra, meaning 'stolen goods.' It's a simple, forceful word: take what isn't yours.",
      "British soldiers and administrators in India adopted 'loot' to describe the spoils of war and conquest. The irony is rich: the colonizers borrowed the colonized's word for robbery to describe their own plundering of India.",
      "'Loot' entered standard English in the 18th century and quickly expanded beyond military contexts. You could loot a store, loot a treasury, loot in a video game. The Hindi word for theft became English's most direct term for taking what you shouldn't.",
      "The word carries its history: every time we use 'loot,' we're using the language of colonial plunder, a word that came to English from the people being plundered. It's a linguistic souvenir of empire."
